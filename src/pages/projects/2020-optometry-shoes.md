## The Scope

2020 Optometry was attending an eye wear trunk show in Las Vegas and wanted to print a design on Converses to wear at the show. I had no idea Converse did custom print design on shoes like this, so this was a very intriguing project for me. I knew they would want something fun and energetic, so I chose to design something that had a lot of movement and that would be representative of their culture.

## About the Design
<div class="columns">
<div class="column is-9">

After some discussions with the client, the only major restriction they had was that they were told (by the exibitor) that they couldnâ€™t use their logo. Since this company is very close and driven by their comraderie, I felt it was necessary to tie their brand to the design of the shoes, somehow. 

Therefore, I encorporated the iconic part of their logo (the eye) within the design and tied in other elements that resonated with their team. For example, the lines coming from the eye could be interpreted as a wave and/or eyelashes (they love the ocean, fishing, and, of course, eyes!).</div>

## The Result
After sharing the design and mock-ups with the client, they were extremely ecstatic and took them to print the week after. They also reported that they received a plethora of compliments!
