![Milestone Website](/uploads/Laptop-Phone.jpg)

Milestone started as an IT Relocation company and quickly evolved into an IT Managed Services Provider based on consumer needs. We continuously redesigned and refreshed the website to align to our growing service offerings.

## The Challenge
The current website had an immense amount of areas of improvement. Not only did we did a deep dive into understanding Milestone’s vision, but we also wanted to implement a cleaner look with more calls-to-actions and more efficient responsive design. In addition, we also wanted to implement a scalable way to track leads and improve the overall customer journey.

## The Redesign
Due to the previous legacy implementation of responsive design, I took it upon myself to completely redevelop the website’s back-end. I implemented Bootstrap to take advantage of its robust grid system and improved a lot of our modules in the CMS.

We started with the business requirements–which, at a high-level, were to represent Milestone as an IT Managed Services Provider with an Intelligence Automation spin. From a Marketing perspective, we wanted a very clean look-and-feel and to put more emphasis our CTA’s  and blog (which we were also going to launch with the redesign).

#### Improving the Customer Journey
Going into this project, we knew we needed to implement nurture campaigns and lead generation programs. A huge part of the redesign revolved around how we can reach our customers through Thought Leadership blogs and creating informational collateral. Before this, Milestone did not have an efficient way of tracking marketing leads or a way of nurturing contacts.

  #### Creating a Scalable Environment
  I created our micro sites and CTAs using an external marketing automation tool and then created templates for our CMS to consume. Since we were generating a lot of content, it was imperative that our environment could easily scale without sacrificing user experience. In the end, the templates that I created allowed us to:

  * Easily create assets and offers along with micro sites and forms
  * Track contacts and automate nurture campaigns
  * Produce 2 Thought Leadership blog posts per month
  * Dynamically add content to the main site as content was created
  * Implement a consistent design between two different platforms

## The Impact
Overall, we drastically increased SEO and generated hundreds of contacts resulting in over $10MM in opportunity value. For a good amount of time, one of our blog posts was featured as the top result for Best IT Strategy.
